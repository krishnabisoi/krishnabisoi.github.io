## 👋 About Me

I am a **Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience** working across **telecom, enterprise data platforms, and analytics systems**, currently completing my **Master’s in Data Analytics** from Clark University.

I specialize in:
- Turning **large, messy datasets (10M+ records)** into reliable insights.
- Building **SQL-driven analytics pipelines** and **business-ready dashboards**.
- Ensuring **data accuracy, validation, and reporting integrity** for decision-makers.

I’ve worked in **production environments** at Accenture and Amdocs supporting global clients like **British Telecommunications (BT)** and **SingTel**, and I now focus on analytics, BI, and data engineering roles in the U.S. market.

## 📊 Projects

### Electric Vhicle Trends & Range Forecasting
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends in the United States, with a deep focus on Washington State, using publicly available government data. The study examines Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to uncover patterns in adoption, electric range, pricing, and geographic distribution.

Beyond exploratory analysis, the project builds a machine learning model to predict EV type using vehicle attributes such as make, model year, and electric range.
